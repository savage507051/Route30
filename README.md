Route30 is a client-side JavaScript routing library.

This library is developed as a capstone project in the MGIS program at Penn State.

The purpose of this library is to allow web app developers to incorporate routing in their applications. The routing library is intended to be a simple, cost-effective solution that may be particularly useful to local governments and non-profits.
