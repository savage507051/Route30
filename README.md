# Route30
Author: George Adams, Southwest Research Institute® (SwRI®)

Date: January 26, 2021

Route30 is a client-side JavaScript routing library.

This library is developed as a capstone project in the MGIS program at Penn State.

The purpose of this library is to allow web app developers to incorporate routing in their applications. The routing library is intended to be a simple, cost-effective solution that may be particularly useful to local governments and non-profits.

## Web App
A demo web app was developed to show how the library could be used. The demo web app can be accessed using the following QR code:

## Deploy
To deploy the web app and Route30 library, copy all of the folders to a web server with the exception of the demo folder. Place the files from the demo folder in the root directory.

## User Guide
To see more information on how to build your own web app and use the library, see the user guide under the wiki tab.
